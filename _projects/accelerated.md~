One of the algorithms for optimizing under L0 (sparsity constraints) is to alternatingly perform a gradient descent and a thresholding step. This is called Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT). We propose a new algorithm for IHT which does accelerated gradient descent instead of vanilla gradient descent. We are looking to prove guarantees for this algorithm.
