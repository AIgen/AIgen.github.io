Conformal inference is a distribution-free way of performing predictive inference [1, 2]. For a description of the prediction problem that conformal solves and some standard references for conformal inference, please read Section 1 (introduction) of our paper linked below. This repository contains an implementation of our novel conformal method, QOOB [3] and other baseline conformal methods. Conformal inference (and QOOB) have primarily been developed for regression but can be extended to non-regression problems, such as classification.
