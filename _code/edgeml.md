The ProtoNN trainer can now be cloned from [https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML](https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML). The trainer can be used to obtain machine learning models that are just a few kilobytes large for classical datasets such as MNIST. It also gives models in the range of a few megabytes for very large datasets with upto 100,000 labels.
