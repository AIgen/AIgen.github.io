I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am being advised by [Prof. Aaditya Ramdas](http://stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). I am interested in studying theoretical aspects of machine learning, including various topics in statistics and machine learning. 

Earlier, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/). I obtained an undergrad degree (B. Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/). 

Have a look at the projects and publications sections to learn about my recent work.
