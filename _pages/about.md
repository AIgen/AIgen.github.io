I am a second year PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am being advised by [Prof. Aaditya Ramdas](http://stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). I am interested in studying theoretical aspects of machine learning, which includes various topics in statistics and machine learning. Currently, I am spending most of my time thinking about assumption-free uncertainty quantification in classification and regression problems. 

Earlier, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India with [Dr. Prateek Jain](http://www.prateekjain.org/). I obtained my undergrad (B. Tech) in Computer Science and Engineering friom the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/). 

Have a look at the projects and publications sections to learn about my recent work.
