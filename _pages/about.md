**Hello**

I am a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research, India. Previously, I did my B. Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/). I am interested in aspects of learning theory, optimization and statistics that are relevant to practical machine learning applications. In particular, I am excited by these areas: 
- Iterative optimization methods
- Nonconvex optimization
- Causal inference

Have a look at the projects and publications sections to learn about my recent work.
